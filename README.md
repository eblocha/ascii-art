# Ascii Art

This is a collection of my ascii art for display in neofetch

## Tux.txt

Tux uses these ascii colors in the neofetch config file:

```txt
# (blue, black, white, yellow, blue, blue)
ascii_colors=(39 232 250 220 39 39)
```

Only colors 2, 3, and 4 are used. This is best on a grey background terminal.
